# Featherforce // Sky Raid (Rebuild)

A full repo rebuild focused on one thing: **fun first**.

## What changed
- New arcade core with tighter controls and cleaner game loop
- Contra-inspired pressure pacing (waves, projectiles, mini-boss cadence)
- Bird commandos (Bluejay/Cardinal visuals)
- Mobile-first controls (left/right/boost/fire)
- Zero backend dependencies

## Controls
- Keyboard: A/D move, W boost, J/Space fire
- Mobile: on-screen controls
